[Project Description](https://)

▶ The project’s initial question is to find out what are the metrics that correlate with the fatality rate. Secondly I seek to understand variable trends in shark attacks fatality rate, like the fatality ranking by location. Then I answer what are the most frequent types of injuries? In order to achieve this objective, it is necessary to import pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn libraries and use dataframe’s manipulation basics like filtering, cleaning and graph analysis.


▶ Variables:
Area, fatality, age, activity, genre, species of shark, type of injury,time of attack

▶ Metrics:
Number of attacks per location
Rate of fatal attacks by location
% attacks by gender
% of attacks by activity
% fatality by shark species

▶Status Project: to be completed

▶Conclusion: The conclusion is that although shark attacks have doubled in the past 2 decades, the fatality rate remains with a normal fluctutation. The doubling of attacks has, according to scientists, to do with global warming. Warming oceans  are destroying marine ecosystems and forcing marine creatures to dramatically adapt to the changing environment.

▶ Extraction: Kaggle
